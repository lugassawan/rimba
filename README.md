## Features

🌿 **Core Workflow**

- **Automatic branch naming** — configurable prefix (e.g. `feat/`, `fix/`) applied to task names
- **Dotfile copying** — auto-copies `.env`, `.envrc`, `.tool-versions` into new worktrees
- **Duplicate worktrees** — copy an existing worktree with auto-suffixed or custom name
- **Local merge** — merge worktree branches into main or other worktrees with auto-cleanup
- **Sync worktrees** — rebase or merge onto the latest main branch, with bulk sync support

🔧 **Automation**

- **Shared dependencies** — auto-detect lockfiles and clone dependency directories using copy-on-write
- **Post-create hooks** — run shell commands after worktree creation (e.g. `./gradlew build`)
- **Auto-cleanup hook** — post-merge Git hook that cleans merged worktrees after `git pull`
- **Stale cleanup** — prune stale references or auto-detect and remove merged worktrees

🖥️ **Developer Experience**

- **Status dashboard** — colored tabular view with dirty state, ahead/behind counts, and filtering
- **Worktree navigation** — open worktrees or run commands inside them via `open`
- **Shell completions** — bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
- **Cross-platform** — Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64/arm64)

## Installation

### Quick install (Linux/macOS)

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lugassawan/rimba/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Go install

```sh
go install github.com/lugassawan/rimba@latest
```

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lugassawan/rimba.git
cd rimba
make build
# Binary is at ./bin/rimba
```

## Quick Start

```sh
# Initialize rimba in your repo
rimba init

# Create a worktree for a task
rimba add my-feature

# List all worktrees with status (colored output)
rimba list

# Remove a worktree when done
rimba remove my-feature --branch
```

## Commands

### `rimba init`

Initialize rimba in the current repository. Detects the repo root, creates `.rimba.toml`, and sets up the worktree directory.

```sh
rimba init
```

### `rimba add <task>`

Create a new worktree with a branch named `<prefix><task>` and copy dotfiles from the repo root.

```sh
rimba add my-feature
rimba add my-feature --bugfix        # Use bugfix/ prefix instead of feature/
rimba add my-feature -s develop      # Branch from a different source
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--bugfix` | Use `bugfix/` branch prefix |
| `--hotfix` | Use `hotfix/` branch prefix |
| `--docs` | Use `docs/` branch prefix |
| `--test` | Use `test/` branch prefix |
| `--chore` | Use `chore/` branch prefix |
| `-s`, `--source` | Source branch to create worktree from (default from config) |
| `--skip-deps` | Skip dependency detection and installation |
| `--skip-hooks` | Skip post-create hooks |

### `rimba list`

List all worktrees with their task name, type, branch, path, and status. The current worktree is marked with `*`. Output is colored by default.

```sh
rimba list
rimba list --type bugfix        # Show only bugfix worktrees
rimba list --dirty              # Show only dirty worktrees
rimba list --behind             # Show only worktrees behind upstream
rimba list --no-color           # Disable colored output
```

Example output:

```
TASK            TYPE     BRANCH              PATH              STATUS
* auth-flow     feature  feature/auth-flow   feature-auth-flow [dirty]
  fix-login     bugfix   bugfix/fix-login    bugfix-fix-login  ↑2 ↓1
  ui-cleanup    chore    chore/ui-cleanup    chore-ui-cleanup  ✓
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--type` | Filter by prefix type (e.g. `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`) |
| `--dirty` | Show only worktrees with uncommitted changes |
| `--behind` | Show only worktrees behind their upstream branch |
| `--no-color` | Disable colored output (also respects `NO_COLOR` env var) |

### `rimba open <task> [command args...]`

Open a worktree or run a command inside it. When called with just a task name, prints the worktree path. When given additional arguments, executes that command inside the worktree directory.

```sh
rimba open my-task              # Print worktree path
cd $(rimba open my-task)        # Navigate to worktree
rimba open my-task code .       # Open in VS Code
rimba open my-task claude       # Launch claude in worktree
```

### `rimba remove <task>`

Remove the worktree for the given task. Optionally delete the local branch.

```sh
rimba remove my-feature
rimba remove my-feature --branch     # Also delete the local branch
rimba remove my-feature -f           # Force removal even if dirty
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--branch` | Also delete the local branch |
| `-f`, `--force` | Force removal even if the worktree is dirty |

### `rimba rename <task> <new-task>`

Rename a worktree's task, branch, and directory.

```sh
rimba rename old-task new-task
rimba rename old-task new-task -f  # Force rename even if locked
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-f`, `--force` | Force rename even if the worktree is locked |

### `rimba duplicate <task>`

Create a new worktree from an existing worktree, inheriting its branch prefix. Auto-generates a `-1`, `-2`, etc. suffix unless `--as` is provided.

```sh
rimba duplicate auth              # Creates feature/auth-1 from feature/auth
rimba duplicate auth --as auth-v2 # Creates feature/auth-v2 from feature/auth
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--as` | Custom name for the duplicate worktree (instead of auto-suffix) |
| `--skip-deps` | Skip dependency detection and installation |
| `--skip-hooks` | Skip post-create hooks |

### `rimba merge <source-task>`

Merge a worktree's branch into main or another worktree. When merging into main, the source worktree and branch are auto-deleted unless `--keep` is set. When merging between worktrees, the source is kept unless `--delete` is set.

```sh
rimba merge auth                           # Merge into main, delete source
rimba merge auth --keep                    # Merge into main, keep source
rimba merge auth --into dashboard          # Merge into worktree, keep source
rimba merge auth --into dashboard --delete # Merge into worktree, delete source
rimba merge auth --no-ff                   # Force merge commit
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--into` | Target worktree task to merge into (default: main/repo root) |
| `--no-ff` | Force a merge commit (no fast-forward) |
| `--keep` | Keep source worktree after merging into main |
| `--delete` | Delete source worktree after merging into another worktree |

> **Note:** `--keep` and `--delete` are mutually exclusive. Merging to main deletes the source by default; merging to another worktree keeps it by default.

### `rimba sync <task>`

Sync worktree(s) with the main branch by rebasing (default) or merging. Fetches the latest changes from origin first.

```sh
rimba sync my-feature                # Rebase a single worktree onto main
rimba sync my-feature --merge        # Use merge instead of rebase
rimba sync --all                     # Sync all eligible worktrees
rimba sync --all --include-inherited # Include duplicate worktrees
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--all` | Sync all eligible worktrees (skips dirty and inherited by default) |
| `--merge` | Use merge instead of rebase |
| `--include-inherited` | Include inherited/duplicate worktrees when using `--all` |

> **Note:** Dirty worktrees are skipped with a warning. On conflict, the rebase is automatically aborted and a recovery hint is printed.

### `rimba hook install`

Install a `post-merge` Git hook that automatically runs `rimba clean --merged --force` after `git pull`. The hook only fires on the default branch (e.g. `main`), so pulling on feature branches is unaffected.

```sh
rimba hook install           # Install the post-merge hook
```

### `rimba hook uninstall`

Remove the rimba post-merge hook. Preserves any other content in the hook file.

```sh
rimba hook uninstall         # Remove the rimba hook
```

### `rimba hook status`

Show whether the rimba post-merge hook is currently installed.

```sh
rimba hook status            # Check installation status
```

> **Note:** `rimba hook` works with or without `rimba init`. The hook coexists with existing user-defined hooks in the same `post-merge` file.

### `rimba deps status`

Show detected dependency modules and lockfile hashes for all worktrees.

```sh
rimba deps status
```

Example output:

```
refs/heads/main (/path/to/repo)
  node_modules [a1b2c3d4e5f6]
  vendor [7g8h9i0j1k2l]
refs/heads/feature/auth (/path/to/worktrees/feature-auth)
  node_modules [a1b2c3d4e5f6]
  vendor [7g8h9i0j1k2l]
```

### `rimba deps install <task>`

Detect and install dependencies for a specific worktree. Clones from an existing worktree with a matching lockfile hash, or falls back to the configured install command.

```sh
rimba deps install my-feature
```

### `rimba clean`

Prune stale worktree references, or detect and remove worktrees whose branches have been merged into main.

```sh
rimba clean                          # Prune stale worktree references
rimba clean --dry-run                # Preview what would be pruned
rimba clean --merged                 # Detect and remove merged worktrees (with confirmation)
rimba clean --merged --force         # Remove merged worktrees without confirmation
rimba clean --merged --dry-run       # Show merged worktrees without removing
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be pruned/removed without making changes |
| `--merged` | Detect and remove worktrees whose branches are merged into main |
| `--force` | Skip confirmation prompt when used with `--merged` |

> **Note:** `--merged` works with or without `rimba init`. Without a config file, it falls back to auto-detecting the default branch.

### `rimba update`

Check for the latest release on GitHub and update the binary in place.

```sh
rimba update             # Check and update to latest
rimba update --force     # Also works on dev builds
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force` | Update even if running a development build |

> **Note:** If the binary cannot be replaced due to file permissions, rimba automatically retries with `sudo`.

### `rimba version`

Print version, commit, and build date.

```sh
rimba version
# rimba v0.1.0 (commit: abc1234, built: 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z)
```

## Configuration

`rimba init` creates a `.rimba.toml` file in the repo root:

```toml
worktree_dir = '../myrepo-worktrees'
default_source = 'main'
copy_files = ['.env', '.env.local', '.envrc', '.tool-versions']

# Post-create hooks (run in new worktree directory)
post_create = ['./gradlew build']

# Dependency management (optional — auto-detect is on by default)
[deps]
auto_detect = true

# Manual module overrides (supplements or overrides auto-detected modules)
[[deps.modules]]
dir = 'node_modules'
lockfile = 'package-lock.json'
install = 'npm ci'

[[deps.modules]]
dir = 'api/vendor'
lockfile = 'api/go.sum'
install = 'go mod vendor'
work_dir = 'api'
```

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `worktree_dir` | Directory for worktrees (relative to repo root) | `../<repo-name>-worktrees` |
| `default_source` | Branch to create worktrees from | Default branch (e.g. `main`) |
| `copy_files` | Files to copy from repo root into new worktrees | `.env`, `.env.local`, `.envrc`, `.tool-versions` |
| `post_create` | Shell commands to run in new worktrees after creation | (none) |
| `deps.auto_detect` | Auto-detect dependency modules from lockfiles | `true` |
| `deps.modules[].dir` | Dependency directory to clone (e.g. `node_modules`) | — |
| `deps.modules[].lockfile` | Lockfile used to match worktrees (e.g. `pnpm-lock.yaml`) | — |
| `deps.modules[].install` | Install command to run if no matching worktree is found | — |
| `deps.modules[].work_dir` | Subdirectory to run the install command in | (repo root) |

**Auto-detected ecosystems** (when `auto_detect` is enabled):

| Lockfile | Dep directory | Install command | Behavior |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `node_modules` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | Recursive clone + install fallback |
| `yarn.lock` | `node_modules` | `yarn install` | Recursive clone + `.yarn/cache` |
| `package-lock.json` | `node_modules` | `npm ci` | Recursive clone + install fallback |
| `go.sum` | `vendor` | `go mod vendor` | Clone only (skip if no match) |

> **Note:** Dependencies are shared using copy-on-write clones (`cp -c` on macOS, `cp --reflink=auto` on Linux) for near-instant copies on supported filesystems (APFS, Btrfs). Falls back to regular copy on other systems.
